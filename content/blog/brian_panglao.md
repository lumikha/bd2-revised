Our family’s next vacation destination was the beautiful island of Panglao in Bohol, still in the Visayas island group, in the Central Visayas Region in south-central Philippines. Taking about one and a quarter hour plane ride from Manila, we reached the capital of Bohol province, Tagbiliran. It then took us a little less than 30 minutes by car to reach Panglao from Tagbilaran airport. It was a smooth ride to the southwestern tip of Bohol, Philippines.

We then arrived on a strip of resorts and dive centers on the southern side of Panglao island called Alona Beach. Alona Beach is considered to be the main association when one says Panglao. We stayed in Chill-out Guest House. The resort’s website describes it as “fenced by abundant trees and neatly filed bamboos, Chill-out Guesthouse Panglao in Bohol, Philippines is the nature-inspired retreat your senses long for. The guestrooms, each fitted with the basics, do away with overwhelming frills and inspire you to adopt a simple lifestyle. You may not be close to commercial establishments, but what you get is the sheer pleasure of being minutes away from stunning natural attractions. All these and more are offered at budget-friendly rates, waiting to be embraced entirely by you.” That description slowly and graciously unfolded before our very eyes during our stay at the resort. You can read more about Chill-out here.

The very friendly resort staff assisted us in our short tour in the island. After a day appreciating the island’s beauty and basking under the summer sun, we chilled in their Chillout Bar. After some drinks, great conversations and before hitting the sack that night, we indulged with the resort’s super relaxing massage service. It was indeed a day and night well spent in the tropics. As the resort would put it, “the only time you can actually see and feel the world’s splendor is when you’ve separated yourself from the flurry and distractions of the city.” They did not disappoint us.

__Dive Panglao__

Panglao is also well-known for its exceptional underwater scene, one of the must-dives destinations of the Philippines. Many of the resorts in Panglao are Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) certified dive resorts. They offer scuba diving, PADI Dive Courses, dive safaris and dive travel in Alona Beach, Panglao Island, Bohol, Philippines. Panglao has around 16 dive sites that dive enthusiasts can explore to, adding to more than 18 more dive sites in nearby islets.

There is so much more to explore in Panglao and in the whole province of Bohol. Perhaps the next time we head to this part of the Philippines, it would be to explore its magnificent caves and wonderful terrains. — Brian Dudley, Makati City, Manila, Philippines
