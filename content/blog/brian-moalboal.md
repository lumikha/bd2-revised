__CEBU, Philippines__— Let’s head down to Central Visayas, to a paradise almost 90 kilometers south from the Queen City of the South—Moalboal, known for its snorkel and dive sites.

Believed to be one of the south’s best white beach destination, the Municipality of Moalboal is located on the south-western tip of the province of Cebu, Philippines. It is between the towns of Alcantara and Badian where diving and snorkeling sites abound, a long stretch of white beach is seen plus that calming atmosphere of sea waves and municipality vibe. Reaching the mildly busy Moalboal town market after boarding a bus from Cebu City (it took us almost three hours), we took a local transport bringing us to our resort.

The first obvious attraction in Moalboal is its White Beach. A surely relaxing ambience of a long stretch of powder-fine white sand that caressed our soles as we walked and appreciate it’s relaxing vibe. We took a dip in its waters which are as clear as crystal while giving us a view of a picturesque horizon outlining the humps of the Cuernos de Negros mountains of Negros Oriental. We spent our evening lying down on the sand, stargazing with a bottle of wine—a perfect scene in that pristine beach.

If you came over for the diving, you sure won’t get disappointed as more than 10 dive sites proliferate in the area flourished by an abundance of varied marine life. You don’t have to go that far from the beach as the reef drop-off is relatively near. You better grab your underwater cameras and take a selfie with the massive school of sardines that Moalboal is popular of.

Under Moalboal’s jurisdiction is Pescador Island, a popular tourist attraction and coined as one of the best dive sites in the area. Expect to see coral gardens, schools of diverse fish species, turtles and even sharks.

If you are sufficed with nearby wonders, you can always snorkel by the reefs just a few meters from the beachfront. You won’t get disappointed since corals, fish and other marine life thrive just as near. And you can also enrol in diving lessons there if you want to take your game higher.

We bought some souvenirs from the small shops along the beach front too. Locals there are always ready to help you out to make your stay in their laid-back paradise as heavenly as possible. — Brian Dudley, Makati City, Manila, Philippines
