__MANILA, Philippines__ — We decided to have a quick weekend getaway to a popular destination that is just close from home. Just two to three hours from the Philippine capital Manila, Tagaytay is a vacation destination even for an instantaneous decision because of its proximity—just 55 kilometers away providing an easy escape for the locals from the extreme heat of Manila’s urban jungle.

Tagaytay City is a component city in the province of Cavite in the Philippines. It is considered one of the Philippines’ most popular tourist attraction because of its superb scenery and cooler temperature due to its high altitude as compared to the increasingly scorching heat of the Metro—one basic reason why we took this quick getaway. It is because of this that is it called the “The Country’s Second Summer Capital,” next only to Baguio City way up north of Luzon.

The most popular attraction in Tagaytay is its overlooking scenery of the Taal Lake in Batangas which grants one of the iconic scenes of the Philippines, the view of the Taal Volcano Island in the middle of the Taal Lake. This can actually be seen in many viewpoints in Tagaytay. We also overlooked scenes of the Manila Bay to the north and Laguna de Bay to the east.

Tagaytay’s mostly forest and open grassland surroundings gave us that extra relaxing mood. We were surrounded by mists due to its lower humidity. This place is truly ideal for leisure activities such as picnics, horseback riding, zipline riding, motorboat adventures, among many others. — Brian Dudley, Makati City, Manila, Philippines
